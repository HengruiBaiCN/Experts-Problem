# Experts-Problem

## General info
This project is the implementation of the weighted majority algorithm and multiplicative weights update algorithm.
* expert.py contains the functions of all experts as well as the adversary.
* main.py contains the function of the algorithm as well as the output function
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.8.10
	
## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ main.py
```
The terminal will then output a list of regrets of the weighted majority algorithm of different number of days.

And also 6 plots that shows the trend of the accuracy of both algorithms.
